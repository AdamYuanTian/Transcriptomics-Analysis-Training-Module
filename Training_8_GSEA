1. Perform GSEA analysis using DEGs resuls from Training 3

2. Visualize GSEA results with Bubble Plot
(1) Prepare a summary csv file by combining all your GSEA results (Training8_GSEA Hallmark Gene Summary.csv is provided here as an example)
(2) In the exmaple file, Description (without HALLMARK_), NES, and qvalues (as FDR) are copied from orginal GSEA results
(3) Type and Condition can be edited based on need. In this example, Type is labeled with different stages of cancer
(4) Category is determined based on Hallmark gene category (https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S2405-4712(15)00218-5)
(5) Positive_value is based on NES

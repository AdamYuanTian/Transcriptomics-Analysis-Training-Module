I hope you have successfully installed R and RStudio and added your first R package.
 
For this time, we will try to use R for loading and processing some data and plotting the result. I have included the data and R script in folder 2.

Here is a list of things we can try:
1.	Figure out how to load the R script and run the code line by line.
2.	Understand the meaning for each line of code. You can either search online or use the Help window at the right bottom of RStudio.
3.	Plot the result and export the figure. (you should be able to adjust the format or layout of the figure using the Plots window at the right bottom of RStudio)

To start this process, here is a list of things I would like you to try:
1.	Install R
2.	Install RStudio (this is a good IDE for R)
3.	Get familiar with the user interface in RStudio
4.	Set the library path (where you install all the packages later) to a place you like. I think its default path is in OneDrive, which sometimes has limited space. You can keep it as default if you donâ€™t mind.
5.	Try to install the first package called BiocManager (which is the Bioconductor packages we will be using a lot).
 
There should be plenty of information telling you how to do these on Google or YouTube, and searching answers online is a very typical way for learning programming.
